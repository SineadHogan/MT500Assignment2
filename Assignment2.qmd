The data used to generate this report was gathered by Unicef. The proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older, subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence, by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, is an indicator of the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goal 5.2: Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.

*Figure 1: Prevalence of Abuse per Country*

Figure 1 displays the prevalence of domestic abuse among the countries included in the data set. 

- The highest prevalence of abuse is observed in Papua New Guinea. 

- The lowest rate of domestic abuse is observed in Armenia. 

```{r}
 Unicef_Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Prevalence_of_Abuse, Life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
*Figure 2: Life Expectancy versus prevalence of abuse*

Figure 2 displays a moderate negative relationship between the rate of domestic abuse in a country and its life expectancy. This demonstrates the negative effects of violence against women on the health of the population. 

```{r}
 Unicef_Data%>%
  ggplot(aes(Prevalence_of_Abuse, GDP)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
*Figure 3: Life Expectancy versus prevalence of abuse*

Figure 3 demonstrates a moderate negative relationship between the rate of domestic abuse in a country and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This demonstrates the negative effects of violence against women has on a countries economy. This therefore, supports the research reporting that the missed work of female victims of domestic abuse, translates to lost productivity for businesses and the overall economy (WHO, 2018). 

```{r}
Unicef_Data%>%
  ggplot(aes(Year,`Prevalence_of_Abuse`))+
  geom_line()
```
*Figure 4: Prevalence of Abuse recorded per Year*

Figure 4 These values represent the years in which data was recorded and the degree of abuse recorded during each.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Unicef_Data, aes(x = Year, y = Prevalence_of_Abuse)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```
*Figure 5: Prevalence of Abuse recorded per Year*

Figure 5 demonstrates an apparent increase in the observed value of domestic abuse over time. There is a marked decrease in levels of recorded abuse demonstrated in 2013, before rising significantly in 2014.   

This report has demonstrated an associated between a countries rate of domestic abuse and both life expectancy and GDP. The findings of this analysis position the achievement of the UN SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, as of both social and economic importance.
